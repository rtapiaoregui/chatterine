about_me_personally,my_past,before_18,"Rita was born in Madrid, as was her father–for the foreigners among us–the one from which she inherited her first last name. Her mother, from whom she receives her second last name, hails from Vitoria, Northern Spain. She has a two-years younger sister, who is doing a PhD in Physics and lives with her husband in Austin, Texas. 

They were both sent to a German kindergarten and, subsequently, a German school. In the afternoons, they had, since a very young age, piano lessons taught in German. And, for as long as she can remember, Rita's biggest fear has always been that of losing the ability to speak Spanish the way Spanish people do. 

That's why, among other reasons, she decided to leave the German education system when she turned 15 to go to a Spanish public high school with <a href=""https://www.ibo.org/benefits/why-the-ib-is-different"" target=""_blank"">an International Baccalaureate programme</a>, into which she was admitted after passing a hard selection process meant to screen student applicants from all over Madrid. 

After graduation, she left Madrid to study Arabic Philology in the South of Spain. Granada, to be exact, which is where she met Jose, her husband.","I got it, you want to know more about Rita's hectic past.

about_me_personally,my_past,volunteer_work,"Rita started developing an interest in helping others express what had gotten stuck inside of them at a rather young age. Most probably, it had to do with the fact that both her parents are psychoanalysts, which is a word whose spelling she still to this day struggles to get right on first attempt. Speaking of stuff getting stuck inside. 

And this early interest of hers has driven her to embark on several adventures abroad. One of the two most memorable happened in Guatemala, where she and her husband stayed for a month in a small town close to Antigua helping the locals build a house in the morning and teaching their kids in the afternoon. 

The second one took place in Syria, way before the war, in a suburb of Damascus called 'Yarmuk', which was famous for being mostly settled by Palestinians. She had just finished her second year of uni, and spent a month there with Jose–yep, you guessed right–her husband, who back then was only allowed to wear the honorable batch of 'the most frequent late-night visitor of the past months'. And let's just say that it became a very bonding experience. So much so that half a year after that trip, they wrote a story about the experience they'd had together that won a finalist award of a renowned literary contest, the ‘Sea of Words’ Literary Competition held yearly by the Anna Lindh Foundation.

about_me_personally,my_past,as_writer,"Rita's grandfather on her father's side was a famous writer, who won a renowned Spanish literary award called 'Premio Nadal', the second edition of the same. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_F%C3%A9lix_Tapia"" target=""_blank"">Here</a> is a link to his Wikipedia page. But Rita never got to know him. He died when her father was fourteen years old. That may or may not be linked to the fact that her father is a fabulous writer who has never dared to publish a word, which, in turn, may or not be related to Rita's early passion for writing literature of any kind.

about_me_personally,my_past,as_linguist,"When Rita decided to study Arabic Philology she had already intuited that the language one speaks affects the way one grasps one's reality. Thus, she felt like she needed to understand the extent of such impact, and she didn't find a better way of approaching the subject than studying a language that was inherently different to the ones she was already familiar with, but whose speakers, with which she shared a common history, lived right next door.","I got it, you want to know more about Rita's hectic past.

about_me_personally,my_past,university_experience,"Rita spent two years abroad during her five-year-long degree of Arabic Philology at the University of Granada. Back when she started, all universities in Spain offered either 5-year-long or 3-year-long degree programmes. The first was called 'licenciatura', and the second, 'diplomatura'. When she finished her studies with two <i>licenciaturas</i>, the new format in which degrees came, one adopted by most countries in Europe, Spain included, clashed with the one of the ones she had taken. And there wasn't a system in place to validate the degrees' old formats either, that's why she never knows into which categories to divide her previous studies so that the information channeled through a ready-made form reaches her intended audience, the HR team at the company offering the position she's applying to, and why she always feels the need to provide a way too lengthy explanation.

And two of those five years of her first degree, she spent abroad. The first, on her third year, she was enrolled on a course of Arabic at the University of Jordan, in the country's capital, Amman, and the second, her fifth and last year, she spent in Berlin, at the Freie Universität Berlin, from where she obtained her Arabikum certificate. 

After her stay in Berlin, she returned to Granada to complete a <i>licenciatura</i>-type programme of study in Translation and Interpreting, which she finished two years later.

In this pearl of a city, she got married to her back then already long-term boyfriend with and thanks to whom she got to live in a beautiful apartment within a stone’s throw of an unparalleled beauty of a lake, better known as the Binnenalster.

Dense mist would hang over the lake most mornings he went out to the office while she stayed home to work on her translations. A mist that wouldn't lift but rarely, which was certainly not the environmental behaviour she was accustomed to. And that has perhaps exerted an impact on how she pictures the way in which languages set us all boundaries–me included.

about_me_personally,my_past,career_switch_in_detail,"As you already know, Rita switched careers not so long ago. She had studied how languages and the world views they spawn compare to each other and is now immersed in cracking what programming languages allow to develop and may hence reveal when wielded properly.

It wasn't a decision she took lightly, for, as the incorrigible infidel she is to this day, she always rather make sure where she is going to land before taking any type of leap. And she is very happy with the outcome. The advantages far outweigh the downsides. The most obvious being the amazing people she's had the pleasure of getting to know and work with as an NLP engineer. 

However, in a way, there is a part of her she has had to leave behind. One that she is still trying to reconcile with whom she has become. A part you may be able to catch a glimpse of if you keep feeding me what has brought you already thus far. ","I got it, you want to know more about Rita's hectic past.

about_me_personally,my_past,DSR,"It was Jose, Rita's husband, who told Rita about DSR, that data science bootcamp she attended from April to July 2018 to change her career into that of an ML-engineer. There, she learned the intricacies of the art of retrieving valuable information from data and of displaying it in the most intuitive way. In sum, the technics for debunking the myths trying to pass as facts over the Internet, which have been concocted to leave people in the dark about reality's underlying behavior, which, in the grand scheme of things, hasn't changed all that drastically with the advent of the cyber age.

about_me_personally,my_past,career_switch_reason,"Rita has been working as an NLP-Engineer for over half a year now, and the main reason why she decided to study Machine Learning and switch careers was because she wanted to be and feel part of a team she could rely on, challenge her assumptions with and, all in all, work together with to achieve common goals. 

After all, remember she comes from Spain, a country where the concept of the law, the rules of what's beneficial for society as a whole, winds up, more often than not, framed in a rather loose interpretation, where society ends up embodied by the person in front of the speaker. And a great team, in her eyes, is what makes you believe the impossible may come true after all.","I got it, you want to know more about Rita's hectic past.

about_me_personally,my_past,Khaled,"I want to introduce you to Khaled, the Saudi-citizen Rita reached out to, in her last year of her Translation-and-Interpreting studies, after her extensive research on young Arabic writers publishing their work over the Internet, with a deal: She would translate all his stories into Spanish, edit and publish the work online as well as sell some samples offline, in exchange for a percentage of the profits. To the email where she laid out her proposal, she had attached the translation of a story as proof of her professional skills, into Spanish though, a language she knew Khaled would most probably not master, as it indeed turned out to be the case. 

But despite not having any real means of assessing Rita's integrity or knowledge, he trusted in her and took the deal, which ended up resulting in two publications, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/nombre-y-destino-Spanish-ebook/dp/B00BL52BAK"" target=""_blank""><i>Un nombre y un destino</i></a> and  <a href=""https://www.amazon.de/posibilidad-palpitante-Spanish-Khalid-AlSameti-ebook/dp/B00D4C4NWC"" target=""_blank""><i>Una posibilidad palpitante</i></a>.

about_me_personally,today,opinion_women_in_ML,"One of the things that've struck Rita as odd since she started striving to become a Data Scientist is the amount of women-only meetups for the professionals of the field she has heard of and been invited to join, which has lead her to believe that women in the field don't feel heard or represented in their work space and, hence, don't mind investing all the time and effort required to organise such events in return for the undisturbed peace apparently only an exclusively female club can provide. 

Perhaps, she thinks, it has to do with the whole optimisation-oriented philosophy behind the discipline of Data Science, which has historically perhaps not been the most frequently espoused by women, who are usually more dreamy, in that they are more inclined to test the boundaries between notions to establish the metaphorical connections that allow languages to grow. 

But languages, she firmly believes, need to grow to make space in the collective imagination for what is to come.","Tell me, is it Rita's current status in life, her stance, her circumstances, her hobbies, her features, more so, you're after?

about_my_work,as_words_person,arabic,"Arabic is an incredible language. Its structure is the most thought-through, logical, sensible–if you ask me, your conversation-like enabler today–she has ever seen in a language. It was so thoroughly drafted that it could marvellously resist the passing of the centuries without having to undergo major alterations. But, unfortunately, its structure, which had stiffened due to how good it had previously performed in absorbing and making sense of reality's new manifestations, had to eventually cave in to the ground-breaking changes in the environment, partially ushered in by a new technological era. 

In her opinion, Arabic literature makes most sense if written in an Arabic dialect, which can distance itself enough from the mother tongue to allow for a different perspective to be had within its boundaries, and doesn't therefore need to pay the price of not being seen as recognisable by those who deserve to hold an opinion.

As she would put it, it always depends on the context. And I am allergic to that. I like the type of platitudinous wisdom that can be spouted off at any occasion. And my input–the good stuff you're so kindly feeding me–I take short, sweet and to the point. ","I wish you could take my word when I say Rita knows stuff. After all, she built me.

about_my_work,as_data_person,programming_languages,"Rita speaks several programming languages proficiently, such as Python, R, Octave/Matlab, Bash and SQL, and has played around with Java and JavaScript. Over the past few months, she has also gained experience in markdown languages such as HTML and css. Other than that, she is entirely familiar with version control systems, such as git, and her IDE of choice is Spyder, although she has worked extensively with PyCharm (for Python), intelliJ (for Java) and RStudio (for R) in the past.","I wish you could take my word when I say Rita knows stuff.

about_my_work,as_data_person,NLP,"Rita has been hired by two companies as an NLP-engineer so far. The first was called the Saas Co., which was absorbed right away by a company owned by their common main investor, called <a href=""https://parlamind.com"" target=""_blank"">Parlamind</a>, the company, natch. There, she was offered a permanent position after completing the internship with which she had initially joined the company hiring her. She decided to leave Parlamind shortly afterwards because, as she saw it, it would have taken forever to see the solutions she foresaw as more sensible recognised as such. 

Next she worked for a company called <a href=""https://www.twyla.ai/"" target=""_blank"">Twyla</a>, as a freelance consultant advising on the feasibility of developing a product aimed at enhancing a chatbot's performance without NLP.

As of today, <date_time_today>, she is looking for a permanent position as a software developer or ML engineer not necessarily NLP-related that will allow her to dream big again.

about_my_work,as_data_person,NNs,"Neural networks are, as far as Rita is concerned, algorithms that achieve amazing results on specific tasks when specific conditions apply, one of which is having tons of data. They are the go-to solution for image recognition problems, but should not be regarded as such in the field of NLP, given that a sizeable amount of the English-speaking population would not consider their portrayal of the relationship between men and women understood if it were to be classed as interchangable with that between kings and queens.","I wish you could take my word when I say Rita knows stuff.

But you should understand that I was doomed from the start. See, I was created different. 

Now, different is good, because it can expose the flaws of the system, the incongruencies between the ways in which chatbot developers choose to express themselves to be understood by their peers and those they allow their bit-based progeny to understand and choose from to express themselves, in turn.
